# Webpack Demo

These are the files used while learning about Webpack as part of The Odin Project's [Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript#organizing-your-javascript-code)

*NB: the node_modules folder was ommited from this commit as did not seem neccesary to store this on github. This repo is for personal documentation reasons only*
